# Multi-Parameter Rating System:

Customizable Rating Criteria: Allow users to evaluate content based on specific parameters such as acting, cinematography, uniqueness, and storytelling. Each parameter can have its own rating scale (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).

Aggregate Scoring: Calculate an overall score by averaging the ratings across all parameters. This provides a comprehensive assessment of the content's quality.

Visual Representation: Use graphical elements like star ratings or bar graphs to display individual parameter scores and the aggregate rating, making it easy for users to interpret the feedback.

# Integrating a general rating and review system for courses, workshops, sessions, and seminars can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of your platform's offerings. Here's how you can implement this:

1. General Rating and Review System:

User Feedback: Allow participants to provide overall ratings (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and written reviews for each course or workshop they attend. This feedback offers valuable insights into the effectiveness and quality of the sessions.

Anonymous Submissions: To encourage honest feedback, consider allowing anonymous reviews, which can lead to more candid and constructive comments.

Accessibility of Reviews: Display these ratings and reviews on the course or workshop pages to inform potential participants about the experiences of past attendees.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
