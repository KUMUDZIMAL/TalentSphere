Make sure that you are making connections with people in the field, but the people you connect with will not be able to advocate for you unless they know you are credible, dependable, and have the skills that you need to be successful in this field. Myth: “Your first internship or job determines what you will do for the rest of your life.” Reality: Strive to obtain an internship that is related to how you want to utilize your EMST degree so that you can become better prepared for a career in the industry. Your first internship or job can help you to develop transferrable skills and qualities that you may take with you into your next internship or job, but in no way does it determine what the rest of your career will be like.

Myth: “It doesn’t matter what kind of experience I get; I just need experience.” Reality: Experience is good to have but having experience that allows you to develop skills and qualities in your specific field will make it easier for you to be able to demonstrate to employers that you are a competitive candidate. Myth: “Film and TV production professionals will recruit me for a job.” Reality: Industry professionals receive a ton of resumes for open jobs due to high demand. There is little to no need to recruit for positions because they usually depend on their networks to fill various roles. This means you will have to work hard to find positions and network to find the right people who are hiring. ABOVE-THE-LINE VS. BELOW-THE-LINE Some common terms that you may see while searching for a job in the entertainment industry are “above-the-line” and “below-the-line.” The \"line\" refers to a line drawn in a budget. Both above-the-line and below-the-line positions are critical in the creative development of a project, but they entail"

It is also important to know that above-the-line positions are not the same thing as top-level jobs nor are below-the-line jobs the same as entry-level jobs. People typically do not “work their way up” from below-the-line jobs to above-the-line jobs as these are two categories and not two levels. In order for you to know which category is right for you, it’s important to know the difference! Above-the-Line Above-the-line jobs are usually ones in which those filling the positions are responsible for leading the creative development of and securing the funding for the project. These are members with the largest amount of power over the project. The salary for these jobs is typically fixed. Some examples of some above the line jobs include: • Screenwriter • Producer • Director • Casting Director • Actor Below-the-Line People in below-the-line roles are typically responsible for the day-to-day work required to complete a project. There are more below-the-line positions than there are above-the-line positions, contributing to a wider variety of jobs that are considered below-the-line. Often the pay for these jobs is hourly.

RESUME GUIDELINES A resume shares your education, skills, and experience with employers. This is your chance to highlight your most relevant experience for the internship or job. Keep these ideas in mind: What should I put on my resume? Include relevant experiences from work, internships, class projects, volunteering, campus involvement, leadership opportunities, and personal projects related to the field. How Should I organize my resume? Place the most relevant experiences toward the top of your resume. Start with your name and contact information followed by Education. Then focus on relevant experiences and projects. What does a resume look like in Entertainment? Entertainment resumes are more likely to contain several short -term projects than other communication industry resumes. Entertainment resumes should follow a traditional format rather than a creative format. In most cases, entertainment employers expect to see a one- column resume that is easy to read quickly and that clearly communicates your qualifications. Where can I get feedback on my resume?
